# Online-Discussion-Platform-Milestone-2

Online discussion platform milestone 2 is the continuation of the Online discussion platform milestone 1 that I completed previously. In milestone 2, I expanded the capabilities of the platform by adding more features, for instance, rating, display user location, third party api(direction),captcha, filtering,wishlist,item search,and  course recommendation.

Technical skills I used to develop milestone 2: HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Bootstrap, CodeIgniter(PHP framework),SQL,MySQL,phpMyAdmin.

1. Rating: Rating is a function which allows users to rate a question. If they think that is a good or interesting question, they can give it a like by pressing the like button under the question. The rating function helps users to consider the value of a question, so that they can use it to decide if they want to spend more time on the question or not.

The following image shows what it looks like when the question is not liked.
