# Online-Discussion-Platform-Milestone-2

Online discussion platform milestone 2 is the continuation of the Online discussion platform milestone 1 that I completed previously. In milestone 2, I expanded the capabilities of the platform by adding more features, for instance, rating, display user location, third party api(direction),captcha, filtering,wishlist,item search,and  course recommendation.

Technical skills I used to develop milestone 2: HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Bootstrap, CodeIgniter(PHP framework),SQL,MySQL,phpMyAdmin.

1. Rating: Rating is a function which allows users to rate a question. If they think that is a good or interesting question, they can give it a like by pressing the like button under the question. The rating function helps users to consider the value of a question, so that they can use it to decide if they want to spend more time on the question or not.

The following image shows what it looks like when the question is not liked.

The following image shows what it looks like when the question is liked by the user.

2. Display user location: Display user location is a feature within the “Contact Us” feature. When users leave a comment in the “Contact Us” section, everything will be saved to the database. In addition to the comments and the images from the users, the application will retrieve the users location and log into the database. We want to log users' approximate location with users comments into our database, since location-based information may be useful for the team to analyze users preference for specific regions. This is a useful feature for marketing purposes.

The image below shows the structure of the database table. The last column of the database table records the approximate location of the users when they leave a comment on the “Contact Us” section.
